  # = Sinatra::ConfigFile
  #
  # <tt>Sinatra::ConfigFile</tt> is an extension that allows you to load the
  # application's configuration from YAML files.  It automatically detects if
  # the files contain specific environment settings and it will use those
  # corresponding to the current one.
  #
  # You can access those options through +settings+ within the application. If
  # you try to get the value for a setting that hasn't been defined in the
  # config file for the current environment, you will get whatever it was set
  # to in the application.
  #
  # == Usage
  #
  # Once you have written your configurations to a YAML file you can tell the
  # extension to load them.  See below for more information about how these
  # files are interpreted.
  #
  # For the examples, lets assume the following config.yml file:
  #
  #     greeting: Welcome to my file configurable application
  #
  # === Classic Application
  #
  #     require "sinatra"
  #     require "sinatra/config_file"
  #
  #     config_file 'path/to/config.yml'
  #
  #     get '/' do
  #       @greeting = settings.greeting
  #       haml :index
  #     end
  #
  #     # The rest of your classic application code goes here...
  #
  # === Modular Application
  #
  #     require "sinatra/base"
  #     require "sinatra/config_file"
  #
  #     class MyApp < Sinatra::Base
  #       register Sinatra::ConfigFile
  #
  #       config_file 'path/to/config.yml'
  #
  #       get '/' do
  #         @greeting = settings.greeting
  #         haml :index
  #       end
  #
  #       # The rest of your modular application code goes here...
  #     end
  #
  # === Config File Format
  #
  # In its most simple form this file is just a key-value list:
  #
  #     foo: bar
  #     something: 42
  #     nested:
  #       a: 1
  #       b: 2
  #
  # But it also can provide specific environment configuration.  There are two
  # ways to do that: at the file level and at the settings level.
  #
  # At the settings level (e.g. in 'path/to/config.yml'):
  #
  #     development:
  #       foo: development
  #       bar: bar
  #     test:
  #       foo: test
  #       bar: bar
  #     production:
  #       foo: production
  #       bar: bar
  #
  # Or at the file level:
  #
  #     foo:
  #       development: development
  #       test: test
  #       production: production
  #     bar: bar
  #
  # In either case, <tt>settings.foo</tt> will return the environment name, and
  # <tt>settings.bar</tt> will return <tt>"bar"</tt>.
  #
  # If you wish to provide defaults that may be shared among all the
  # environments, this can be done by using a YAML alias, and then overwriting
  # values in environments where appropriate:
  #
  #     default: &common_settings
  #       foo: 'foo'
  #       bar: 'bar'
  #
  #     production:
  #       <<: *common_settings
  #       bar: 'baz' # override the default value
  #
